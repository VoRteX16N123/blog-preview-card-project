## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use fexbox better with this challenge. The use of flexbox can be seen in the code snippet below: 

```css
.flexbox{
  font-weight: var(--fw-bold);
  font-size: 0.9rem;

  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 1.2rem;
}
```
